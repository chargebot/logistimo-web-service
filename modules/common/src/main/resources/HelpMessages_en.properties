For example: If there is a sheet called "Inventory" into which inventory data should be pasted, enter "Inventory" in the Inventory Sheet Name text box. At least one of the sheets names should be entered. Make sure that the sheet name correctly matches with the sheet name in the Excel workbook that is uploaded.
